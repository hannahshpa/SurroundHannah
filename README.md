# FBU Surround App

**Platform:** Android mobile application

## Developers
Hannah Park (UCLA, June 2021), Heriberto Gonzalez (Pomona, May 2020), Greta Browne (Yale, May 2021)

## Premise
Many groups find themselves speakerless in situations that call for amplification. Surround connects phones and turns them into a surround sound system so people get a great audio experience even without speakers. 

## Features
•	Two roles: The “controller” phone selects the audio track and manipulates how it will be played on the “speaker” phones

•	Audio playback of any audio file in up to 5.1 surround sound (pause, play, seek, restart, volume)

•	Users on controller phones can move the sound from speaker phone to speaker phone in order to “throw” the sound around a space

•	Speaker phones use a live query-enabled Parse server to listen for updates from the controller phones (global clock, play/pause, volume, location, etc.)

•	Option to have multiple controllers play different audio tracks on the speaker phones

## Recognition
Selected out of 20 Android teams built by Facebook interns, and was presented to *Mark Zuckerberg* at the end of team's software engineering internship
