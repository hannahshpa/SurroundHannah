FBU Surround App

Surround
Platform: Android
Developers: Hannah Park (UCLA, June 2021), Heriberto Gonzalez (Pomona, May 2020), Greta Browne (Yale, May 2021)
Premise: Many groups find themselves speakerless in situations that call for amplification. Surround connects phones and turns them into a surround sound system so people get a great audio experience even without speakers. 
Features: 
•	Two roles: The “controller” phone selects the audio track and manipulates how it will be played on the “speaker” phones
•	Audio playback of any audio file in up to 5.1 surround sound (pause, play, seek, restart, volume)
•	Users on controller phones can move the sound from speaker phone to speaker phone in order to “throw” the sound around a space
•	Speaker phones use a live query-enabled Parse server to listen for updates from the controller phones (global clock, play/pause, volume, location, etc.)
•	Option to have multiple controllers play different audio tracks on the speaker phones
